      of banknotes.

      Within this family of banknotes, some modifications were
      made that included changes in the emblem, and others of a commemorative nature.
      In addition, the security measures of the banknotes against counterfeits that
      were made by color photocopies and scanners were increased. In 1997 the RD$5
      note was no longer printed, to be replaced by a coin.'

      Power, through a Decree project that established a design change for banknotes.
      bank that make up the fifth issue, as well as the new drawings, legends, denominations
      and other characteristics that the new banknotes would henceforth contain and
      that additionally included a new denomination of RD$2,000 (Two Thousand Pesos
      Gold), commemorating the exchange of millennium. This project was approved
      by means of Decree No.212-99 dated May 13, 1999. The first three denominations
      of RD$2,000.00, RD$100.00 and RD$10.00, were put into circulation as of December
      1999.

      Over the years, the banknotes belonging to this family have undergone
      various modifications to the original design structure, which have included
      technical adjustments, such as: inclusion of new security elements, increased
      ''intaglio'' coverage, inclusion in the watermark with electrotype of the value
      of the denomination in numeric characters and fluorescence to the iridescent
      band, among others.

      In 2007, a new denomination of RD$200 pesos gold
      bills was introduced, which was integrated into the fifth family as a medium-denomination
      bill that would have the same characteristics, dimensions and securities as
      the RD$100 pesos denomination bill. . In addition, in 2010, the RD$20 peso
      gold bill was put into circulation, on a polymer substrate, which retains a
      design similar to the RD$20 cotton bill, with security measures adapted to
      the new substrate.

      Additionally, in 2011, the name of the national monetary
      unit "Golden Pesos" was replaced by "Dominican Pesos", in compliance with the
      provisions of Article 229 of the Constitution of the Republic, promulgated
      on 26 January 2010, when the Central Bank introduced changes to the substrate
      of low-denomination banknotes and included a new security element called SPARK
      in high-denomination banknotes. Currently, seven bill denominations are in
      circulation: RD$2,000; RD$1,000.00; RD$500.00; RD$200.00; RD$100.00; RD$50.00
      and RD$20.00 and four denominations of metallic coins (RD$25.00, RD$10.00,
      RD$5.00 and RD$1.00 pesos).'

      4, instructed the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic to include the Rosa
      de Bayahibe flower, Pereskia Quisqueyana Alain, in the new editions of the
      Paper Money, replacing the Mahogany Flower as of 2014.

      In this sense,
      the Central Bank made changes to the design of the bills of the Dominican Republic,
      thus creating the 6th family of bills, the most recent in circulation. These
      banknotes present a more modern image, while retaining their traditional characteristics
      for which they already stand out, but designed according to the most up-to-date
      technological advances.

      The new bills of the denominations of RD$2,000.00,
      RD$1,000.00, RD$500.00, RD$200.00, RD$100.00 and DOP50.00, were put into circulation

      Republic, other commemorative bills have also been issued for circulation and
      with allegorical overstamps to important events. In 1955, the RD$20 bill circulated
      with the motto alluding to the Era of Trujillo, bearing the phrase "Year of
      the Benefactor of the Homeland."

      In 1977, with the purpose of exalting
      the 30th Anniversary of the creation of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic,
      the Monetary Board authorized the sealed envelope of circulating bills, a re-seal
      that was made in our printing house. These banknotes were given to personalities
      and Bank officials, as well as numismatic collectors.

      In 1992, numismatic
      technicians from the Central Bank proposed the printing and subsequent circulation
      of a series of banknotes commemorating the V Centenary of the Discovery and
      Evangelization of America. The first bill issued in this series was the RD$500
      bill, being the only one designed entirely by Dominicans. Other bills of RD$1000,
      RD$500 and RD$20 were then issued, but only with the inscriptions alluding
      to said commemoration.'
